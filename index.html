        <h3>Scholarships: all you need to know</h3>
        <p>Scholarship is financial aid provided to a student on a certain basis, usually primarily academic merit. They can be based on several eligibility criteria such as needs, country or region of origin, gender, field of study, race, etc. Scholarship money does not have to be paid back as it is not a loan. They come in the form of grants, tuition waivers and fellowships. Scholarship is a wonderful approach to assist students in getting through their education―usually higher education. They are awarded to relieve students (prospective and previously enrolled) and their families a significant part of the huge financial commitments of higher education. </p>

        <p>There are many different organizations and programs out there for students who want to study abroad. Rotary International is one to be considered. While being well-known for many benevolent causes, one of their biggest programs is offering young students around the world the opportunity to travel and live abroad. I went on a year-long exchange with the Rotary Youth Exchange in France and had the best year of my life. Rotary International is a “worldwide organization of business and professional leaders that provides humanitarian service and encourages high ethical standards in all vocations.”</p>
